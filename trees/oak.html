        <p>Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. We'll put a happy little bush here. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things.</p>

        <p>There are many varieties of oak trees in the world, but the one thing they all have in common is acorns. We need dark in order to show light. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. We'll do another happy little painting.</p>
