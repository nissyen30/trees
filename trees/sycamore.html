        <p>There are many varieties of Sycamore in the world, but the species native to the Eastern United States is appropriately called the American Sycamore. Also called the American Planetree, this attractive and distinctive tree was common at one time as a shade tree in cities due to its ability to handle the characteristics of an urban habitat. Due to its susceptibility to cankers which can cause unattractive lumps, it has been replaced in this capacity in many places by the London Plane tree. The sycamore is easy to spot in all seasons due to its distinctive camouflage appearance that occurs due to the irregular flaking of the bark.</p>

        <p>The leaf of the American Sycamore is similar in structure to that of a Maple leaf, but has distinctive ridges along the edge of the leaf similar to the ridges on a saw blade. If you are not confident in being able to distinguish between the appearance of this leaf and that of Maple or other similar trees, you can instead easily identify this tree by its bark. The bark has a very distinctive pattern similar in appearance to woodland or desert camouflage patterns.</p>
