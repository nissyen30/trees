        <p>Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. We'll put a happy little bush here. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things. Learn when to stop. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. Just make a decision and let it go. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. You can do it.</p>

        <p>There are many varieties of oak trees in the world, but the one thing they all have in common is acorns. We need dark in order to show light. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. We'll do another happy little painting. Learn when to stop. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. Just make a decision and let it go. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. You can do it.</p>
