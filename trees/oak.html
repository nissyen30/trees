        <p>Various species of Oak tree are found in the Northern Hemisphere on every continent where the Oak tree is often synonymous with strength. Less well known is that the Oak tree is also a keystone species with many other species being dependent upon the presence of the Oak; in some cases an Oak tree can even be the heart of a small ecosystem. Oak trees are found in deciduous forests where the native Oak species shed their leaves in winter but is also found in more southern locations where the Oaks (commonly called Live Oaks) are evergreen and usually retain their leaves year round.</p>

        <p>The leaves of the many species of Oak trees can vary widely in appearance from having smooth to serrated edges or from a single elongated leaf to a leaf with many lobes. The bark also can range from short to elongated scales. However, the one thing that all Oaks have in common is the ubiquitous acorn. The leaf pictured here is from a Scarlet Oak tree and has both multiple lobes and partially serrated edges. The bark of the Scarlet Oak is primarily made of elongated scales but the appearance can be irregular.</p>
