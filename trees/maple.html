        <p>When people hear the word Maple, they might be thinking of the flavor that has been made famous by this common species of tree. Commercially available Maple syrup is commonly made from the sap of the Sugar Maple tree, but can also be made from the sap of many other varieties of Maple tree. Varieties of the Maple tree are found throughout North America, Europe, and Asia where the tree is commonly planted for ornamental purposes and its wood is used for many different purposes.</p>

        <p>Maple leaves are wide and usually have either 3 or 5 lobes. The leaf pictured here (taken from a Silver Maple) has 3 lobes. The serrated edges of the Silver Maple make it easy to identify from other types of Maple. During parts of the year, the maple will drop seeds in the form of samaras (also called helicopters). The bark of the Silver Maple occurs in long strips than most other Maples and peels off easily.</p>
