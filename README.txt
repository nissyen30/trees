This is the README file for my Front End Dev project.

My chosen project was to create a site with information for identifying trees.

There are no special instructions for running this project; all of the links are based off the folder structure that has been created.

I will be fulfilling the following Feature Requirements:

•	X  A navigation menu that collapses into a “hamburger” expandable menu on mobile devices and is fully displayed on a desktop-size screen - this will be found on the project.html page
•	X  Use flexbox to rearrange 2 or more content areas on your page as the screen changes sizes - this will be found on the project.html, oak.html, maple.html, & sycamore.html pages
•	X  Use media queries to switch from a one-column mobile layout to a two or more column desktop layout - this will be found on all of the pages
•	X  Use “:nth child” CSS to style a series of elements (for example, change the color of every 2nd item in a list) - this will be found on the project.html page
•	X  Create an image carousel with at least 3 images that it rotates through - this will be found on the project.html page
