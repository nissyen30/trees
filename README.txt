This is the README file for my Front End Dev project.


My chosen project was to create a site with information for identifying trees.


I have been advised that my page looks a little basic compared to others. Due to a course conflict and a misunderstanding about when this course would be starting, I have essentially had 8 weeks (instead of 12) to complete the requirements for this course so that I can move on. My focus in this class is on learning as much coding as I can and, with myself having a month less to learn before moving forward, I have chosen to spend the time I have learning instead of focusing on the aesthetics of my project. However, I have reviewed my project with my Mentor and it works as expected and meets all requirements.


There are no special instructions for running this project other than that you should have an active internet connection. The structure of this page was tested using both Google Chrome and MS Edge.


I will be fulfilling the 4 following Feature Requirements:

•	Use flexbox to rearrange 2 or more content areas on your page as the screen changes sizes - this will be found with the menu on the project.html page which flexes to remain spaced correctly and with the three-columns rule used on the oak.html, maple.html, & sycamore.html pages to change the content towards the bottom of the page from 3 block items in one column to 3 flex items in 3 columns.
•	Use media queries to switch from a one-column mobile layout to a two or more column desktop layout - this will be found on the oak.html, maple.html, & sycamore.html pages
•	Use “:nth child” CSS to style a series of elements (for example, change the color of every 2nd item in a list) - this will be found on the project.html page in both the menu at the top and the list of links towards the bottom
•	Create an image carousel with at least 3 images that it rotates through - this will be found on the project.html page


All of the mandatory requirements have also been met.
